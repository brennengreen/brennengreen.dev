		<h3>Physically Based Raytracer</h3>
		<p>Physically Based Raytracer written from scratch in C++. The raytracer implements a monte carlo rendering algorithm presented by Dr. Peter Shirley [NVIDIA].
			The raytracer uses an abstract implementation of materials and surfaces to represent just about any sort of object, medium, etc. that could come to mind.
