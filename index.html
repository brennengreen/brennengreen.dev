            I am a software engineer interested in the domain of computer graphics. I am inspired by the intersection
            of <b>art</b> and <b>technology</b>, specifically for the domains of <b>film</b> and <b>games</b>. I am particularly interested in
            the topics of <b>rendering</b>, <b>animation</b>, <b>game engines</b>, <b>gpu architecture</b>, and <b>GPGPU computing</b>. 
            Through my experiences working at Intel, Twitch, Blizzard Entertainment, and now, DreamWorks Animation I hope to continue my career
            in the entertainment industry building pipelines that enable artists to fulfill their artistic vision to the fullest.
            <br><br>
    
            Computer Graphics is my passion, and I love getting my hands dirty in the low-level details of hardware implementation
            and how it can be used to enable the performance and accessibility of systems across games, movies, and the ever-increasing
            world of GPGPU programming.

                    systems throughout the engine. Specifically, I have worked quite extensively with geometry and animation pipelines to help build
                    a new compute shader based particle system that will allow VFX artists to create high-fidelity, and high-performing, in-game VFX.

                    and viewer interactivity. Coming back for the fall, I built a 2D rendering service which could was used to render stream elements as overlays to the streamers

                    As a software developer, I aim to build creative solutions to problems which impact artists and end-users. 
                    In the past I've worked as a <b>Graphics Programmer</b> at both <b>Twitch</b> and <b>Blizzard Entertainment</b>, building tools which 
                    could be used by artists and creators to fulfil their creative vision. Now, I am a <b>Software Engineer</b> at <b>DreamWorks</b>, working day-to-day
                    with artists to build tools that complement and enhance procedural workflows in Houdini.

                    Personally, my work is focused entirely on computer graphics. Typically I am working on some sort of
                    <b>rendering</b> engine, both <b>physically based</b> and <b>real-time</b>. I have written several rendering algorithms from scratch
                    for my own developmental purposes as well. My goal at the moment is to maintain two fully functional engines. One for
                    real-time optimization work and another for photorealistic work. In development with these engines
                    I typically work with <b>Modern C++</b>, <b>OpenGL</b>, and <b>Vulkan</b>.

                    While an undergraduate, I did research which falls into primarily two areas: <b>Computer Graphics</b> and <b>Machine Learning</b>.
                    As a undergraduate research assistant at UK I worked in both imaging and machine learning. While working
                    in a <b>biomedical imaging lab</b> I developed an optimized biomedical imaging device that would allow the reconstruction of cerebral
                    bloodflow using CUDA and MATLAB. I also did research for the application of convolutional neural networks
                    to characterize part defects and optimize manufacturing processes with the <b>Institute of Sustainable Manufacturing</b> at UK. The bulk
                    of my work involves heavy amounts of <b>data analysis and processing</b> using <b>Python</b> and tools such as 
                    <b>Tensorflow</b>, <b>Keras</b>, <b>Pytorch</b>, <b>CUDA</b>, and <b>Pandas</b> to enable my machine learning workflow.
